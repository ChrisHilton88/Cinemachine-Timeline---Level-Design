# Cinemachine-Timeline---Level-Design
This is the level design project for the Cinemachine &amp; Timeline framework within the GameDevHQ course.

This project ended up having the 'Main' scene overridden, and I took this opportunity to download the last version saved here and import this into a new Unity project,
learning how to resolve all the errors that come with it. All problems solved and new version control created under 'Cinemachine-TimelineProject'.
  - 'Cinemachine-TimelineProject' - Only has 1 version control saved as it is the final project save.
